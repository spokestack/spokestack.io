          <p>
            Instead of having to recognize and respond to anything that can be
            said, like a voice assistant, why not just act on what your users
            know software can do?

          <blockquote>
            Your custom multilingual on-device model recognizes pre-defined
            keywords, sending a transcript of trained commands, each associated
            with one or more utterances. That’s the insight behind{' '}
            <strong>keyword recognition</strong>.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Your software listens for multiple brief commands and supports
            variations in phrasing for each of them—using a fast, lightweight
            model—without user audio leaving the device.

          <h3>Use Case for Keyword Recognition</h3>
          <p>
            Imagine an app designed to control music while running. Classes
            could be named <code>play</code> and <code>stop</code> &mdash;
            we&apos;ll just talk about two for sake of brevity.

                Utterances (variations) for <code>play</code> could include:
              </p>
              <StaticImage
                width={395}

              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            If a user says any of the above utterances, your app would recieve a
            transcript, but the utterances are normalized in a transcript to one
            of your two commands, <code>play</code> and <code>stop</code>,
            making it easy to map the command to the proper app feature.

            The technical term for what a keyword recognition model does is{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification">
              multiclass classification
            </a>
            . Each keyword is a <strong>class label</strong>, and the utterances
            associated with that class are its <strong>instances</strong>.
            During training, the model receives multiple instances of the
            keyword classes and multiple words and phrases that don&apos;t fit
            into any of the classes, and it learns to tell the difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            This probably sounds similar to the training process for a{' '}
            <a href="/features/wake-word">wake word model</a>, and that&apos;s
            because it is: Spokestack&apos;s wake word and keyword recognition
            models are very similar, with small differences at the very end to
            allow the keyword model to detect multiple classes and return the
            label of the class that was detected.

              <p>
                When you create a keyword recognizer, the list of keywords are
                the only text your app will ever see. Each one of those
                keywords, sometimes referred to as{' '}
                <strong>keyword classes</strong> in technical documentation, can
                be thought of as its own miniature wake word model, in that it
                can have different utterances that trigger it. This is why you
                have to add a keyword and an utterance in order to begin
                recording samples: a keyword for establishing the text you want
                returned to your app as a transcript, and an utterance to
                represent the text mapped to that keyword.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each keyword can have one utterance that simply matches the
                keyword&apos;s name (or doesn&apos;t, if you want to change the
                formatting/spelling of some word before your app sees it), or
                several that should all be normalized to the same text before
                your app sees it. The keyword name itself has no correlation to
                the audio meant to trigger it.
