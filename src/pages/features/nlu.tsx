            <strong>Natural language understanding</strong>, or NLU, uses
            cutting-edge machine learning techniques to classify speech as
            commands for your software. It works in concert with{' '}

        <Section title="How Does NLU Work?">
          <p>
            NLU is a task within the broader field of{' '}
            <strong>natural language processing</strong>, or NLP, that focuses
            on processing an individual phrase or sentenct to extract its{' '}
            <strong>intent</strong> and any <strong>slots</strong> containing
            information necessary to fulfill that intent. In other words, it
            fits natural language (sometimes referred to as{' '}
            <strong>unstructured text</strong>) into a structure that an
            application can act on.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many systems, this task is performed after{' '}
            <a href="/features/asr">ASR</a> as a separate step. Occasionally
            it&apos;s combined with ASR in a model that receives audio as input
            and outputs structured text or, in some cases, application code like
            an SQL query or API call. This combined task is typically called{' '}
            <strong>spoken language understanding</strong>, or SLU.
          </p>
          <h3>Example of NLU in Action</h3>
          <p>
            To illustrate the basics of NLU, let&apos;s look at an example
            utterance:{' '}
          </p>
          <StaticImage
            width={814}
            css={styles.stepImage}
            alt="NLU Example"
            src="../../images/features/nlu/example.png"
          />
          <p>
            In this example, this user clearly intends to buy a plane ticket, so
            the intent could be named something like <code>book_flight</code>.
            The flightâ€™s departure time is necessary for the booking, so the{' '}
            <code>book_flight</code> intent would have a slot named{' '}
            <code>departure_time</code>, in this case filled by &ldquo;8:00 AM
            on April 13&rdquo;. A good NLU might further parse that slot value
            into an{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO time string</a>{' '}
            or similar formal representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note, however, that more information is necessary to book a flight,
            such as departure airport and arrival airport. The{' '}
            <code>book_flight</code> intent, then, would have unfilled slots for
            which the application would need to gather further information. An
            NLU component&apos;s job is to recognize the intent and as many
            related slot values as are present in the input text; getting the
            user to fill in information for missing slots is the job of a
            dialogue management component.
          </p>
          <p>
            A convenient analogy for the software world is that an intent
            roughly equates to a function (or method, depending on your
            programming language of choice), and slots are the arguments to that
            function. One can easily imagine our travel application containing a
            function named <code>book_flight</code> with arguments named{' '}
            <code>departureAirport</code>, <code>arrivalAirport</code>, and{' '}
            <code>departureTime</code>.

        <Section title="What Are NLU Techniques?">
          <p>
            Spokestack&apos;s approach to NLU attempts to minimize the distance
            between slot value and function argument through the use of{' '}
            <a href="/docs/concepts/nlu#slot-parsing">slot parsers</a>, designed
            to deliver data from the NLU in the shape you&apos;ll actually need
            in your code. For example, the value of an <code>integer</code> slot
            will be a numeral instead of a string (<code>100</code> instead of{' '}
            <code>one hundred</code>). Slot parsers are designed to be
            pluggable, so you can add your own as needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic task of NLU can be accomplished with many techniques,
            ranging from running{' '}

              regular expressions
            </a>{' '}
            on incoming text to see if it contains any commands relevant to your
            application, classical machine learning methods like classifiers
            driven by{' '}

          <blockquote>
            Spokestack&apos;s NLU uses the third approach, starting with a large
            pre-trained language model and fine-tuning it with data relevant to
            your application&apos;s domain. The fine-tuned model is then
            optimized, resulting in a version that&apos;s small enough to run in
            under a second on a modern mobile device.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that NLU produces two types of output, intents
            and slots. The intent is a form of{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics">pragmatic</a>{' '}
            distillation of the entire utterance and is produced by a portion of
            the model trained as a{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">
              classifier
            </a>
            . Slots, on the other hand, are decisions made about individual
            words (or <strong>tokens</strong>) within the utterance. These
            decisions are made by a <strong>tagger</strong>, a model similar to
            those used for{' '}

            Spokestack makes it simple to train an NLU model for your
            application. All you&apos;ll need is a collection of intents and
            slots and a set of example utterances for each intent, and
            we&apos;ll train and package a model that you can download and
            include in your application.
