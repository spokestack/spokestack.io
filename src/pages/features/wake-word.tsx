          <p>
            Imagine you&apos;re at a party, and everyone&apos;s talking at once.
            There are so many conversations—how do you know if someone is
            talking to you? From the middle of the din, you hear someone call
            out your name. You immediately turn to see who it was and to listen
            for what they&apos;ll say next.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            This is the real-life analog of a software{' '}
            <strong>wake word</strong> &mdash; a word (or set of words) that
            transitions voice technology from listening passively to actively
            attempting to recognize speech in order to act.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            A <strong>wake word detector</strong> uses a machine learning model
            to process the sounds it is sent and listen for what can be thought
            of as its name. For example, you may respond to your first name,
            your family name, your full name, your nickname, and your honorific
            name. So can your software!

            Wake words utilize a wake word detector, which in Spokestack employs

            microphone for specific sounds (like what you can train and build

            without accessing a network or cloud services.
          </Info>
          <p>
            A <strong>wake word detector</strong> is a type of{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification">
              binary classifier
            </a>
            . Some are built to recognize a single word (or class), and some can
            recognize several. During training, the detector hears many examples
            of the desired wake word(s), many examples of other words, and
            background noise, and it learns to tell the difference between them.
            Spokestack&apos;s wake word detectors use a series of three neural
            models to filter user speech to isolate the most important frequency
            components, encode those for classification, and detect the presence
            of a wake word in the encoded version. More detailed information
            about the models themselves can be found in our{' '}
            <a href="/docs/concepts/wake-word">documentation</a>. Splitting the
            task into three stages allows us to process audio as efficiently as
            possible, keeping the process quick and using less power.

                technology components. A wake word can trigger any action in
                your software. For example, a wake word can activate a feature,
                or initiate a workflow. Wake word triggers are a powerful user

                until the wake word is recognized, Spokestack isn&apos;t
                &ldquo;listening&rdquo; to the audio in any real sense.
                It&apos;s merely answering the question, &ldquo;Did I just hear

            Spokestack&apos;s <strong>personal wake words</strong> use few-shot
            transfer learning allowing a small amount of data to produce a
            neural model with an accuracy level suitable for personal, hobby, or
            exploratory projects. These models will perform with good recall for
            the voice (or voices) used in the data it is trained on.
